# OpenOBD2Reader

This is my personal OBD2 project for my Opel Astra J. The car has some issues, and I wanted a better way to read and analyze the data. This tool connects to an OBD2 adapter and shows live data in a simple GUI.

## Features
- Connects to an OBD2 adapter via Bluetooth
- Reads and displays important vehicle parameters
- Supports a dummy mode for testing
- Saves logs for later review

## Status
Still in development. The basic functions work, but I am improving the UI and adding more features.
